                wow good score bai HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA.
                ehem *clears throat*. ummm... to start it off, HAPPY MONTHSARY TO US, PANGGA.
                I MISS YOUUU HEHEHEHEHE. time flies soooo fast fast fast ba? LoL. um... my life with you during these past 
                months have been so memorable. we've been through a lot already even tong not official pata
                naka agi jud tag mga kasakit and kalipay and TBH, every single day is very worth to live
                tungod nimo, b. Who on earth would actually know that the person they're talking to
                is the one they'll end up with. in my case, I never expected na mag kita, and always jud ko thankful
                kay ikaw akong uyab. I cannot imagine how my eyes sparkled when I realized I am in love with you.
                kay ofc diba wabaya ko diritso naka crush saimoha digani ko ganahan saimoha sauna XDDD. pero ga huna
                hunaon nako ba like unsa kaha akong reaction ato nga time nga na realize nanako nga ganahan kos imoha.
                and thinking about it made me realize na ahhh okay probably the same feeling nga akong gaka feel
                everytime gaka kita taka. what I felt for you back then is still the same with how I feel for you today.
                My love for you never deminished. Love kaayo taka, langga always jud na dalha. e sulod sa imong bulsa ang 
                kamatuoran nga palangga taka sa bisag unsa nga panahon. naay time nga ang Father sa Church kay nag state syag line 
                nga "to love is to accept", and sakto jud sya, b, that is how you truly love a person; by accepting them and not
                your idea of them, ana btaw. thus, I want you to always remember also that no matter what you became and what
                you will become, I am still your KirkiBoi, your lover since 2022. palangga, always remember ha nga no matter what happens between us,
                I love you. No matter who you become, I love you. I will always take care of your heart, baby. Happy motmot. I love you, my unicorn.
